# Language-Specific Guidelines

## Java Development

### Code Style and Structure
- Write clean, efficient Java code following semi-senior to advanced patterns
- Use Java 17+ features (records, sealed classes, pattern matching, text blocks)
- Structure applications: controllers, services, repositories, domain models, configurations
- Implement proper dependency injection using constructor injection
- Apply SOLID principles and maintain high cohesion, low coupling

### Spring Boot Best Practices
- Use Spring Boot 3.x with proper starter dependencies
- Implement reactive programming with WebFlux where appropriate
- Use @ConfigurationProperties for type-safe configuration
- Implement proper exception handling with @ControllerAdvice
- Use Spring Security with JWT for authentication
- Implement caching strategies with Spring Cache abstraction

### Testing Strategy
- Write comprehensive unit tests with JUnit 5 and Mockito
- Use TestContainers for integration testing
- Implement contract testing for microservices
- Maintain 80%+ code coverage for business logic
- Use ArchUnit for architecture testing

### Performance Considerations
- Profile applications using JVM tools (JProfiler, VisualVM)
- Optimize JVM settings for production workloads
- Implement proper database indexing and query optimization
- Use connection pooling (HikariCP) with appropriate settings
- Consider GraalVM native images for faster startup

---

## C++ Development

### Modern C++ Standards
- Use C++20/23 features where available
- Prefer smart pointers over raw pointers
- Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
- Leverage STL algorithms and containers
- Apply const correctness throughout

### Game Development Focus
- Optimize for cache efficiency and memory layout
- Use object pools for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Implement efficient collision detection algorithms
- Profile with tools like VTune or Perf
- Consider SIMD instructions for math-heavy operations

### Code Organization
```cpp
// Header guards or #pragma once
#pragma once

// Forward declarations to reduce compilation dependencies
class GameObject;

// Use namespace for organization
namespace GameEngine {
    class PhysicsSystem {
    public:
        explicit PhysicsSystem(float gravity = 9.81f);
        void Update(float deltaTime);
        
    private:
        float m_gravity;  // Use m_ prefix for member variables
        std::vector<std::unique_ptr<GameObject>> m_objects;
    };
}
```

### Build System
- Use CMake for cross-platform builds
- Implement proper dependency management with vcpkg or Conan
- Set up continuous integration for multiple platforms
- Use sanitizers (AddressSanitizer, ThreadSanitizer) in debug builds

---

## Kotlin Development

### Kotlin Idioms
- Leverage null safety and smart casts
- Use data classes for DTOs and value objects
- Implement sealed classes for state management
- Use coroutines for asynchronous programming
- Apply functional programming concepts (map, filter, fold)

### Backend with Kotlin
```kotlin
// Use Ktor for lightweight microservices
fun Application.configureRouting() {
    routing {
        route("/api/v1") {
            authenticate("jwt") {
                get("/users/{id}") {
                    val userId = call.parameters["id"]?.toLongOrNull()
                        ?: return@get call.respond(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest)
                    
                    userService.findById(userId)?.let { user ->
                        call.respond(user)
                    } ?: call.respond(HttpStatusCode.NotFound)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Android Development
- Use Jetpack Compose for modern UI
- Implement MVVM architecture with ViewModel and LiveData
- Use Hilt for dependency injection
- Leverage Kotlin Multiplatform for shared logic
- Implement proper lifecycle management

---

## C# Development

### Unity Game Development
- Follow Unity's component-based architecture
- Use ScriptableObjects for data containers
- Implement object pooling for performance
- Optimize draw calls and batch rendering
- Use Unity's Job System for parallel processing

### Code Patterns
```csharp
// Use properties instead of public fields
public class Player : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private float moveSpeed = 5f;
    
    public float Health { get; private set; } = 100f;
    public event Action<float> OnHealthChanged;
    
    private void TakeDamage(float damage)
    {
        Health = Mathf.Max(0, Health - damage);
        OnHealthChanged?.Invoke(Health);
    }
}
```

### Performance Optimization
- Profile with Unity Profiler regularly
- Minimize garbage collection by pooling objects
- Use burst compiler for performance-critical code
- Implement LOD (Level of Detail) systems
- Optimize texture atlases and mesh combining

---

## Swift/Objective-C Development

### Swift Best Practices
- Use Swift's type safety and optionals effectively
- Implement protocol-oriented programming
- Leverage Swift's powerful enum with associated values
- Use Combine framework for reactive programming
- Write expressive APIs with Swift's syntax features

### iOS Architecture
```swift
// MVVM with Combine
class UserViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published private(set) var users: [User] = []
    @Published private(set) var isLoading = false
    
    private var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()
    private let userService: UserServiceProtocol
    
    init(userService: UserServiceProtocol = UserService()) {
        self.userService = userService
    }
    
    func loadUsers() {
        isLoading = true
        userService.fetchUsers()
            .receive(on: DispatchQueue.main)
            .sink(
                receiveCompletion: { [weak self] _ in
                    self?.isLoading = false
                },
                receiveValue: { [weak self] users in
                    self?.users = users
                }
            )
            .store(in: &cancellables)
    }
}
```
